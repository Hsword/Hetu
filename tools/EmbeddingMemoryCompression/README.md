# (VLDB'24) Experimental Analysis of Learnable Vector Storage Compression for High-dimensional Sparse Data (under revision)

This directory is used for VLDB'24 Artifact Evaluation of paper #282, titled "Experimental Analysis of Learnable Vector Storage Compression for High-dimensional Sparse Data".

## Setup

Our codes are based on Hetu. We provide a cmake file `config.cmake` in this directory; please copy it to `../../cmake` directory and compile Hetu according to the [README](https://github.com/Anonymous-222/EmbeddingCompression/blob/embedmem/README.md#installation) file in the home page of Hetu. After compiling, you can train or infer with `run_compressed.py` in this directory.

## Prepare Datasets
Currently we support Avazu and Criteo datasets.

  - Avazu is provided by Avazu, a mobile advertising platform, at the 2015 ctr prediction competition on Kaggle. It contains 10 days of real data, 40M records in total. There are 22 feature fields for a total of 9.4 million unique features.Avazu can be downloaded manually from https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data.

  - Criteo is part of the 7-day real data provided by the Criteo Lab on Kaggle in 2014. with a total of 46M records. It contains 13 continuous features and 26 feature field with a total of 34M unique features. Criteo is also adopted in MLPerf, a standard benchmark for machine learning performance. Criteo can be downloaded manually from 
  https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kaggle-display-advertising-challenge-dataset/dac.tar.gz.

  - Statistics of the datasets

  | Datasets | Fields | Features | Samples | 
  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
  | Avazu | 22 | 9,449,445 | 40,428,967 |
  | Criteo | 26 | 33,762,577 | 45,840,617 |


- You can place the downloaded datasets into a new folder `datasets` under current directory, and check the script `models/load_data.py` for preprocessing.

## Implementation

* Layers of different embedding compression methods are implemented in [./methods/layers](https://github.com/Anonymous-222/EmbeddingCompression/tree/embedmem/tools/EmbeddingMemoryCompression/methods/layers). It is possible to implement custom compression methods inheriting `Embedding` class.
* Trainers are located in [./methods/scheduler](https://github.com/Anonymous-222/EmbeddingCompression/tree/embedmem/tools/EmbeddingMemoryCompression/methods/scheduler). New trainers must be implemented for custom compression methods.
* Related gpu operators are implemented into the Hetu system in [EmbeddingCompression/python/hetu/gpu_ops](https://github.com/Anonymous-222/EmbeddingCompression/tree/embedmem/python/hetu/gpu_ops).


## Configurations of Embedding Compression Methods
- CompoEmb: we multiple the embeddings from different tables as in the original paper; we only compress the fields that achieve less memory after compression.
- TT-Rec: we decompose the tensor into three small tensors, and vary the rank to adapt to different memory budgets; we only compress the fields that achieve less memory after compression.
- DHE: we use 1000000 buckets and 1024 hash functions as in the original paper, and we use uniform distribution for the input of MLP; we only compress the fields that achieve less memory after compression.
- ROBE: we use Z=1 so that the embedding is not split.
- MGQE: we provide 256 choices for high-frequency features and 64 choices for low-frequency features as in the original paper; we vary number of split parts to adapt to different memory budgets; we use top_percent=0.1, which means the top 10% features are considered high-frequency features.
- AdaptEmb: we use 'top_percent' to denote the ratio of high-frequency features; for different memory budgets, we use different top percent.
- INT8/16: 'digit' can be 8 or 16 for INT8 and INT16 respectively; 'middle' is set to zero to enforce symmetry; 'scale' is tested among several values as in the original paper.
- ALPT: 'digit' can be 8 or 16 for INT8 and INT16 respectively; 'init_scale' is the initial value for scaling; 'scale_lr' is the learning rate for scale, which we set 2e-5.
- AutoDim: we test several configurations, whether ignore the second order term in the gradient of alpha or whether retrain from pre-trained parameters; we set alpha_lr=0.001 as in the original paper.
- OptEmbed: we set the hyperparameters according to the original paper, including 'alpha', 'thresh_lr', 'keep_num', 'mutation_num', 'crossover_num', 'm_prob', 'nepoch_search'.
- DeepLight: we set stop_deviation=1e-3 to ensure the deviation between final pruning ratio and target ratio is smaller than 1e-3.
- AutoSrh: we set nsplit=6, alpha_l1=0.00001 and alpha_lr=0.001.
