# CLIP Example
In this directory we provide implementations for CLIP model on Hetu. Since we have not found the public dataset for training, we only provide the test method for CLIP model. Training codes will be supplemented in the future.

## Test CLIP model
All scripts for testing CLIP model are in `./scripts` directory. Users are free to modify hyperparameters in shell file.

To test Hetu CLIP model, run:
```bash
sh ./scripts/test_hetu.sh 
```
